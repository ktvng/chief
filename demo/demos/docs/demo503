# Overview

In fact, object, classes, and methods are all really the same thing.

# Details

The example above demonstrates a method acting a lot like an object by returning 
itself. Lines [2] creates a new Call named 'Greater' in the method's local scope. 
Line [3] does the same, with the 'self' keyword emphasizing that 'Lesser' is 
to exist in this local scope.


Line [12] returns 'self' which allows both these two calls to be accessed in the 
scope of the returned entity. Line [17] explicity captures this returned entity 
as a Call.
