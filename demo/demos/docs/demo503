# Overview

In fact, object, classes, and methods are all really the same thing.

# Details

The example above demonstrates a method acting a lot like an object by returning 
itself. Line [2] creates a new Call named 'Greater' in the method's local scope. 
Line [3] does the same, with the 'self' keyword emphasizing that 'Lesser' is 
to exist in this local scope (that of ‘Order’).


Line [12] returns 'self' which allows “packages” everything up into an “object” whose
attributes are the local scope of ‘Order’. Both ‘Greater’ and ‘Lesser’ are 
calls defined in this local scope, and so become attributes of the returned entity 
of ‘Order’. 


Line [17] explicitly captures this returned entity and assigns it to the Call ‘Ordering’. 


This example expresses a method functioning as an object. In general, most methods 
do not return ‘self’ and hence do not function as objects.
