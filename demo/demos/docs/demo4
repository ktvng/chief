# Overview

The procedural construction can also be applied to if-statements. One current design 
choice for Pebble is the presence of operator aliases. For instance, the '<=' operator 
is aliased to 'is leq to', 'leq', and 'is less than or equal to'. These are defined 
in the 'grammar.txt' file as preprocessor rules.


An aside on the grammar: The grammar is a freely editable text file which encodes 
CFG (context free grammar) production rules.


# Details

The 'that' keyword in each if-clause refers to the same line, specifically the 
last of code before the execution of the if-statement.


Here we have also made use of the aliases for the '>' operator.
