# Overview

Pebble operators have different aliases defined in the 'grammar.txt' file. This means 
there are a few different ways to express the same thing. We're still testing whether 
this is useful or too confusing...

# Details

The example demonstrates applying the procedural construction to an if-statement. It 
also makes use of two different aliases of the '>' operator on line [4] and [6]. 


These are all defined and documented in './assets/grammar.txt'. Grammar rules are 
simple CFG (context free grammar) production rules.
