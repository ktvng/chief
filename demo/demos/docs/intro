# Intro

Welcome to the Pebble PL interactive demo. Here we highlight a few interesting 
peculiarities of Pebble's syntax, underlying paradigms, and conventions. At the 
end, we'll also give you an opportunity to play around with some of these features 
for yourself.


Pebble is high-level, interpreted language designed to explore how 
syntax and programming primitives can be reimagined in a more familiar, 
human-friendly way. 


Our mission is to create a language that is easy to pick up, 
straightforward to learn, and expressive enough to be useful. 
Achieving these goals involves finding innovative solutions to reduce syntax 
constraints and designing novel ways to think about coding primitives.


We also introduce a new, abstract programming paradigm which can emulate both 
object-oriented and functional-programming paradigms.

The interactive demo is built up of different 'pages'. Each page is intended to 
serve as an overview of a specific Pebble features. It contains an 
actual Pebble program with syntax highlighting, as well as program's actual 
output.


A 'Details' section explains what the syntax does and some of the design motivations 
behind the feature. We encourage you to read all explanations.


Enjoy!
