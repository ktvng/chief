# Intro

Welcome to the Pebble PL interactive demo (becuase documentation is always 
more fun when interactive?). 


Pebble is an open source interpreted scripting language designed to explore how 
syntax and programming primitives can be reimagined in a more familiar, 
human friendly way. Our mission is to create a language that is easy to pick up, 
straightforward to learn, and expressive enough to be impactful. 
Achieving these goals involves finding innovative solutions to reduce syntax 
constraints and designing novel ways to think about coding primitives.

The interactive demo is built up of different 'pages'. Each page consists of a 
true Pebble program which has been parsed, interpreted, and colorized for your 
viewing pleasure. The program's real output is included under it, along with 
an explanation of what's going on under the hood (if necessary).


Certain sections will also include brief descriptions of the motivation behind 
a certain design choice. Enjoy!
