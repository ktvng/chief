# Intro

Welcome to the Pebble PL interactive demo. 
Here we highlight a few interesting peculiarities of Pebble's syntax, patterns, and paradigms. 
At the end, you’ll also have the opportunity to play around in a sandbox and try out some of these features for yourself.

# About

Pebble is high-level, interpreted language designed to explore how syntax and programming primitives can be reimagined in a more familiar, human-friendly way. 


Pebble is designed to be easy to pick up, straightforward to learn, and powerful enough to make an impact. 
Achieving these goals involves finding innovative solutions to reduce syntax constraints and designing novel ways to think about coding primitives.


Pebble also introduces a new programming paradigm which can emulate both object-oriented and functional-programming paradigms.

# Mission

Technology touches us every day in ways that are both profound and unseen. Code governs our everyday. We believe that this technology is power. That it’s transformative--and able to solve some of the world’s toughest and oldest problems. 


Programming is more than a skill. It’s the bridge between man and machine. Simply put, it’s a language. In designing Pebble, we take inspiration from language as well from mathematics. Our mission is to create a programming language that’s accessible to everyone, that feels more literary than mathematical. 


We hope that Pebble gives individuals the courage to dive into programming.
And we hope that in the process, individuals develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the technology around them. 

# Details

The interactive demo is built up of different pages. Each page provides an overview of different Pebble features. It will contain an actual Pebble program and display its true output.


A 'Details' section covers in more depth what’s actually happening. We encourage you to read all explanations.


Enjoy!
