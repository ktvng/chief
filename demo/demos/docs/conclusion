# The End

Thank you for viewing the Pebble PL demo. Our goal when designing Pebble 
was to balance simplicy and flexibility and to make a language that is 
easy to pick-up and fun to learn. 

In the end, we're developing this because we believe not just that this is a 
collection of exciting ideas, but that this has the power to positively impact 
real people. 


Pebble is first and foremost a language with a mission. Our goal is to make 
learning how to program easy and accessible for everyone. We're trying to do away with 
unintuitive syntax and unncessary keywords, to make something lightweight with 
low overhead.





Along the way, we've reimagined and redesigned features that most 
established programming languages have fixed. All of these features 
are expermimental. Some of them might be aweseome, others are bound to be 
confounding--but as we continue to grow and develop, we continue to improve. 



We hope Pebble offers a balance between simple, basic primitives, and a 
wider world of creative and expressive advanced features.



Pebble exists to make coding more accessible to everyone. It's 
designed for an audience, and will continue to evolve 
with them. 

For them, we will continue to design, redesign, and improve Pebble--and we hope that you 
enjoy what you've seen today.
