# Overview

Pebble refers to variables as 'Calls'. If a Call is used before it is defined, it 
will by default refer to 'Nothing', the Pebble equivalent of 'null'/'None'


Calls are actually more complex than variables. They comprise the main primitive of 
the call-binding paradigm (more on this later).

# Definitions

Call: A Call is a Pebble primitive. It's an entity, referenced by name, which stores 
data, similar to a variable.

# Details

Motived by the rule in English where proper nouns are capitalized, Calls must also 
be capitalized. Our hope is that this draws a parallel between a Calls and proper 
nouns. We are still testing this feature, and it is subject to change.


Here 'MyName' is a Call. It's initially undefined (line [1]) and so refers to Nothing. 
We'll cover the 'Nothing' construct in detail later on.
