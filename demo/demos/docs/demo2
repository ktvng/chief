# Overview

Pebble refers to variables as 'Calls'. If a Call is used before it is defined, it 
will by default refer to 'Nothing', which is the Pebble equivalent of 'null'/'None'


Calls are actually more complex than variables, and are the main primitive of 
the call-binding paradigm which Pebble uses (more on this later).

# Details

Motivied by the rule in English where proper nouns are capitalized, Calls must also 
be capitalized. Our hope is that this draws a parallel between a Call and a proper 
noun. This feature, however, is still being tested and subject to change.


Here 'MyName' is a Call. It's initially undefined (line [1]) and so refers to Nothing. 
We'll cover the 'Nothing' construct in detail later on.
