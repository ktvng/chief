# Overview

Pebble refers to variables as 'Calls'. If a Call is used before it is defined, it 
will refer to 'Nothing', which is the Pebble equivalent of 'Null'/'None'


While Calls can be thought of as similar to variables, they are in reality 
slightly more complex to enable certain higher-level functions of Pebble. This 
complexity, however, is not necessary to in order to pick up the basics of Pebble.


Calls must begin with capital letters. The motivation behind this is to relate 
Calls to proper nouns, which in English are capitalized. We are testing this 
feature and very well might decide to change it if it becomes too bothersome.

# Details

Here 'MyName' is a Call. It's initially undefined (line [1]) and so refers to Nothing. 
We'll cover the 'Nothing' construct in detail later on.
