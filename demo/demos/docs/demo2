# Overview

Pebble refers to variables as 'Calls'. Whenever a Call is used, it refers to 
'Nothing', which is the Pebble equivalent of 'Null'/'None'


While Calls can be thought of as similar to variables, they are in reality 
slightly more complex to enable certain higher level functions of Pebble. This 
complexity, however, is easily hidden from the beginner and can be introduced 
later as a sort of "easter egg".


By convention, which is strictly enforced by the compiler, Calls must begin with 
captial letters. The motivation behind this is to equate Calls to proper nouns, 
which in English are captialized. We are testing this feature and very well might 
decided to change it if it becomes too bothersome.

# Details

Here 'MyName' is initially a Call which refers to Nothing. We'll cover how Nothing 
gets handled later on (which will explain why '<Nothing>` gets printed). For now, 
just understand that Nothing can always be printed.
