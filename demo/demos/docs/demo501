# Overview

In Pebble, classes are methods.

# Details

Line [1] demonstrates a simple method. A method, of course, is just a section of Pebble code 
which is executed inside its own local scope.


Line [4] defines another method... but instead of returning a simple value, it returns 
'self'! Specifically, returning ‘self’ here means returning an entity (think "object") whose 
attributes scope is the local scope of the method--here it’s the local scope of 'Class'.


'Attribute1', 'Attribute2', and 'ClsMethod' have all been defined inside this 
local scope, so that returned entity, assigned on line [13] to 'MyObject', has 
all of these Calls as its attributes.


When a method is invoked, it runs over a fresh local scope. This prevents a class from 
overwriting the instance data of previous objects. 


A class can be conceptualized truly as a blueprint for an object--it literally contains 
the instructions required to produce a new object!
