# Overview

In Pebble, classes are methods.

# Details

Line [1] demonstrates a simple method. A method, of course, is just a section of Pebble code 
which is executed inside its own local scope.


Line [4] defines another method... but instead of returning a simple value, it returns 
'self'! Specifically, returning itself means returning an entity ("object") whose 
own scope is the local scope of 'Class'.

'Attribute1', 'Attribute2', and 'ClsMethod' have all been defined inside this 
local scope, so that returned entity, assigned on line [13] to 'MyObject', has 
all of these Calls in its local scope.


Further, when a method is called, it's run on a new local scope. This prevents a class from 
overwriting the instance data of previous objects. 


A class can be conceptualized truly as a blueprint for an object--it literally contains 
the instructions required to produce a new object!
