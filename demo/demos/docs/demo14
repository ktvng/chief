# Overview

Pebble allows for type-unsafe regions. Using the 'Anything' keyword, a Call can 
be marked as purely generic. The compiler assumes that "objects" stored in an 
'Anything' Call are type consistant, and type errors are caught at runtime.

# Details

By assigning 'X' to the 'Anything' type, we allow 'X' to hold members of any 
type. The type of the entity held by 'X', however, is retained, and runtime 
type checking ensures type consistency upon retrival of an object stored in an 
Anything call. 


Note: this feature is partly a bug. We've yet to implement type-casting, and when we 
do, we will reconsider whether or not to enforce explicit type-casting when 
extracting an entity from an 'Anything' call.
