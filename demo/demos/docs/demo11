# Overview

Two facts about Pebble's type system allow for interesting method typing. (1) Methods 
are evaluted on a copy, and (2) types are bound at first assignments. This enables a 
generic-by-default pattern. Creating non-generic methods is also possible and 
can be done in an intuitive way.

# Details

On line [20], 'Introduce' is a method which (by default), takes a generic Call 
named 'Someone'. When this method is invoked, a copy is created, and the Call 
'Someone' of this copy is bound to the type of the parameter. This allows the original 
method to retain its generic, unbound 'Someone' Call.


Notice that 'Introduce' works for all three object types. Further, when line [27] 
attempts to reassign 'Someone' (which is a Noble) to a 'Doctor', a fatal exception 
is thrown by the runtime.
