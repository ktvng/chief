# Overview

Every operation returns a Call. Similarly, every line also returns a 
Call. The keywords 'it'/'that' can be used to refer to the Call returned 
by the previous line.


This allows for a linear, prodecural construction of different expressions.

# Details

The 'it' and 'that' keywords are equivalent, referring to the Call 
returned by the previous line. 


The 'take' keyword has no special function: every line returns a Call, and 
'take' merely emphasizes this fact for readability. Line 
[14] demonstrates the same construction procedural construction with the 
'take' keyword omitted.


In Pebble, 'the' is treated as a one-word comment keyword. It can be injected to improve 
readability depending on the programmer's preference.


One lines [10-11] the 'is' keyword is used. The is keyword is similar to the 
`||=` operator in Ruby. It assigns a value only if the Call refers to Nothing (i.e. is "null"). 
It is intended to be used to signify the initial definition of a Call.
