# Overview

Methods are defined with the ':' operator followed by an indent block. We are currently 
working to support curly-braces for use with lambda expressions!


Parentheses are not required when the method takes zero arguments.
Parenthesis are required when the method takes a non-zero number of arguments. 

# Definitions

Scope: A scope is the set of Calls which are accessible at a given point. An object 
has a scope (its attributes) and a method has a local scope (the scope where its code 
gets executed).

# Details

There is no special keyword required to define method except for the ':' operator. 
To avoid ambiguity, this is the only use of the colon.


Method Calls (such as 'Factorial' on line [1]) are really just Calls which refer to a lambda 
expression. Line [6] demonstrates the syntax for creation and assignment a lambda 
expression. Line [1] does exactly the same, albeit implicitly.


In this way, methods can be regarded as first-class citizens.
