# Overview

Methods are defined with the ':' operator followed by an indent block. In that regard 
Pebble takes on Pythonic attributes. Currently we are working to include support for 
curly-braces as well which will also improve the use of lambda expressions.


Parentheses are optional, and are only needed when there are > 0 arguments

# Details

There is no special keyword required to define method except for the ':' operator. 
This operator is only used in this context to avoid any ambiguity.


Methods are really just 'objects' in a manner of speaking. The standard syntax 
for defining a method (line [1]) is can be understood as the implicit creation 
and subsequent assignment of a lambda to a Call (line [6]). In this regard, 
methods are first class citizens can can be passed as arguments.
