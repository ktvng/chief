# Overview

Methods are defined with the ':' operator followed by an indent block. We are currently 
working to support curly-braces for use with lambda expressions!


Parentheses are optional, and are only required when the method takes a non-zero 
number of arguments

# Details

There is no special keyword required to define method except for the ':' operator. 
To avoid ambiguity, this is the only use of the colon.


Method Calls (such as 'Factorial') are really just Calls which refer to a lambda 
expression. Line [6] demonstrates the syntax for creation and assigning a lambda 
expression. Line [1] does exactly the same, albeit implicity.


In this way, methods can be regarded as first-class citizens.
